# Spring-MVC

1. Framework for building web application.
2. Based on Model view controller design
3. It leverages features of core spring framework (Inversion of Control, Dependency Injection)

## Spring MVC benefits
1. The spring way of building web application UI's in java
2. Leverage a set of reusable UI components
3. Help manage application state for web requests
4. Process form data : validation, convresion
5. Flexible configuration for view layer

## Components of Spring MVC application
1. A set of web pages to layout UI compoenents
2. A collectin of spring beans(services)
3. Spring config(XML,annotation,java)

## MVC

1. Model objects- Contains your data, is like container to ship data between various part of MVC application

2. View templates are JSP pages or view page to render data- Common view template are JSP(Java Server pages) + JSTL(JSP standard tag library)

3. Controller classes are business/ processing logic - Handle the request, store/retrieve data, place data in model 

# Classes

## Hello World clas

1. Creating Spring home controller and view
2. Reading html form data (using @RequestParam) will read req parameter and binds to var name
3. Adding data to spring model

## Student class

1. Spring MVC form tags- support data binding

2. Model attribute is bean that will hold form data and give support for data binding

3. path in html (eg path="firstName";) when form is loaded spring mvc will call student.getFirstName() to populate form field, if null then field will be empty,  when form is submitted spring will call setter methods
student.getFirstName

4. @ModelAttribute to bind form data to java objects

### Used the following Spring MVC form tags

1. Drop down list

2. Radio buttons

3. Checkbox 

## Customer class

### Used the following Hibernate form validation 

1. Required fields
2. Validate number range (Min , Max)
3. Validate using reg exp
4. Custom validation

@InitBinder- works as pre processor. Every web request that process through controller this code will execute 1st

Custom error message for free passes

#### Development process for custom Validation
1. Create custom validation rule
a - Create @CourseCode annotation
b- Create CourseCodeConstraintValidator
2. add validation rule to customer class
3. display error messsages on html form
4. update confirmation pagr



# Creating controller
1. Create controller class (@Controller)
2. Define controller method
3. Add request mapping to controller method (@RequestMapping)
4. Return view name
5. Develop view page


# Read Form data with Spring MVC
1. Create student class 
2. Create student controller class
3. Create html form
4. Create from processing code
5. Create confirmation page
HelloWorld Controller has 2 request mapping /showForm /processForm

# Adding Validation
## Developmnet process
1. Add validation rule to customer class
2. Display error message to html forms
3. Perform validation to controller class
4. Update confirmation page

To validate customer last name without white spaces we use @InitBiner annotation works as a pre processor
It will pre process each web request to our controller. We will use this to trim out string, removing leading and trailing white space, if string has whitespace  we trim it to null object

custom validation
